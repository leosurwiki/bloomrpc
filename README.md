<p align="center">The missing GUI Client for GRPC services. üå∏ </p>

<p align="center">Inspired by <b>Postman</b> and <b>GraphQL Playground</b> <br/>
  <b>BloomRPC</b> aims to provide the simplest and most efficient developer experience for exploring
and querying your GRPC services.

## Forked from the origin to support Any proto
BloomRPC is a GUI for gRPC manual testing. Not only does it provide an interactive way to make gRPC calls, it also automatically generates the gRPC request with mocked data when you select a rpc method.

However, we cannot use it to test our event log libraries since the event envelope encloses an event as an ambiguous ‚Äúany type‚Äù, which is not currently supported by BloomRPC. So we extended BloomRPC to support ‚Äúany type‚Äù, and here is an example of how we manually test the monolith event log forwarder consumer.

Double click a RPC to bootstrap a request with some random mocked data.

Double click a message to fill ambiguous ‚Äúany‚Äù fields.

### Shortcuts

<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd> or <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>: close tab

<kbd>ESC</kbd>: focos editor

<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>: send request

### GRPC Web

GRPC Web is now supported! Just toggle the `GRPC` switch to `WEB`.

Note on https:

- add https to the url, note for GRPC-Web it also supports path, e.g. https://example.com/grpcweb/v1
- or turn on "TLS" -> Server certificate (default port will change to 443)
- self-signed certificate not supported at the moment
